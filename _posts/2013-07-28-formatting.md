Cocoapods is a dependency manager for iOS and OS X projects that makes it easy to integrate 3rd party software. It's just like Ruby Gems, right down to being written in Ruby. The vast majority of open-source Objective-C projects have been made into Cocoapods, but unfortunately many commercial libraries have not been (or else are maintained by their users, rather than the companies themselves). I urge companies to make a Cocoapod for their SDK.
